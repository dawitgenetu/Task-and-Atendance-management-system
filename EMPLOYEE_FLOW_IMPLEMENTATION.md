# Employee Attendance and Dashboard Flow Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that employees must mark their attendance before accessing the dashboard and task management features. After marking attendance, employees are automatically redirected to the dashboard with a success message.

## Flow Summary

### 1. Employee Login
- Employee logs in with their credentials
- System checks their role and attendance status

### 2. Attendance Check (header.php)
- If employee hasn't marked attendance today → redirected to `mark_attendance.php`
- If attendance already marked → can access dashboard and other pages

### 3. Mark Attendance (mark_attendance.php)
- Employee records video for attendance verification
- System processes video and marks attendance
- **NEW**: Employee is redirected to dashboard with success message

### 4. Dashboard Access (dashboard.php)
- **NEW**: Shows success message when redirected from attendance
- **NEW**: Displays today's attendance status for employees
- Shows task statistics and recent tasks
- Employee can now access all employee features

### 5. Task Management (my_tasks.php)
- Employee can view assigned tasks
- Update task status (pending → in-progress → completed)
- View task details and submit files

## Key Changes Made

### 1. mark_attendance.php
```php
// After successful attendance marking
header('Location: dashboard.php?attendance_success=1');
exit();
```

**Added Features:**
- "Go to Dashboard" button when attendance is already marked
- Redirect to dashboard after successful attendance marking
- Updated JavaScript to redirect instead of reload

### 2. dashboard.php
```php
// Check for attendance success message
$attendanceSuccess = isset($_GET['attendance_success']) && $_GET['attendance_success'] == '1';

// Get today's attendance record for employee
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM attendance WHERE employee_id = ? AND date = CURDATE()");
$stmt->execute([$userId]);
$todayAttendance = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```

**Added Features:**
- Success message when redirected from attendance marking
- Today's attendance status display for employees
- Clock in/out times and total hours worked
- Attendance status badge (present/late/absent)

### 3. Navigation Flow
- **Before attendance**: Employee can only access `mark_attendance.php`
- **After attendance**: Employee can access:
  - `dashboard.php` - Main dashboard with statistics
  - `my_tasks.php` - View and manage assigned tasks
  - `mark_attendance.php` - Mark clock out or view attendance

## Database Structure

### Attendance Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE attendance (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    clock_in DATETIME,
    clock_out DATETIME,
    status ENUM('present', 'absent', 'late', 'half-day') DEFAULT 'present',
    video_path VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    video_path_out VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    UNIQUE KEY unique_attendance (employee_id, date)
);
```

### Tasks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    task_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    assigned_by INT NOT NULL,
    assigned_to INT NOT NULL,
    assigned_date DATE NOT NULL,
    due_date DATE NOT NULL,
    priority ENUM('high', 'medium', 'low') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'medium',
    status ENUM('pending', 'in-progress', 'completed', 'cancelled') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (assigned_by) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (assigned_to) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## User Roles

### Employee
- Must mark attendance daily before accessing system
- Can view assigned tasks and update status
- Can submit files and comments for tasks
- Access to dashboard with personal statistics

### Manager/Admin
- Can view all employee attendance records
- Can assign tasks to employees

## Security Features

### Attendance Verification
- Video recording required for clock in/out
- Face direction verification (up, down, left, right)
- Automatic late detection (after 9:00 AM)
- Unique attendance record per employee per day

### Access Control
- Role-based access control
- Session-based authentication
- Automatic redirects based on attendance status
- SQL injection prevention with prepared statements

## Testing

### Test File: test_employee_flow.php
A comprehensive test page that shows:
- Current user status
- Attendance status
- Flow step completion
- Quick action buttons

### Test Steps:
1. Login as employee
2. Check if redirected to mark attendance
3. Mark attendance with video
4. Verify redirect to dashboard with success message
5. Test access to my_tasks.php
6. Verify task management functionality
