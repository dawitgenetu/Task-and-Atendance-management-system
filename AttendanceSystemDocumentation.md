### Backend Structure
- **MVC Pattern (Recommended):**
  - `models/` â€” Database models
  - `views/` â€” HTML/PHP templates
  - `controllers/` â€” Business logic
- **File Structure Example:**
```
includes/
  â”œâ”€â”€ header.php
  â”œâ”€â”€ footer.php
  â”œâ”€â”€ sidebar.php
  â”œâ”€â”€ session.php
config/
  â””â”€â”€ database.php
public/
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.php
  â”œâ”€â”€ login.php
  â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard.php
  â”œâ”€â”€ attendance.php
  â”œâ”€â”€ mark_attendance.php
  â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Frontend Integration
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive design
- **JavaScript** for modals, AJAX, and interactivity

### Database Design
- **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram):**
  - Place ERD image at `/docs/erd.png`
- **Main Tables:**
  - `users`, `roles`, `attendance`, `tasks`, `notifications`, `ratings`
