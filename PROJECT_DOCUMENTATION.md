## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL/MariaDB
- Web server (Apache recommended)
- Composer (optional, if using dependencies)

### Installation
1. **Clone or copy the project files to your web server directory.**
2. **Database Setup:**
   - Import the provided SQL schema (not included here) to create the required tables.
   - Update `config/database.php` with your database credentials.
3. **File Permissions:**
   - Ensure the `uploads/` directory is writable by the web server for video uploads.
4. **Configuration:**
   - Set the correct timezone and base URL in `includes/config.php`.
5. **(Optional) Cron Jobs:**
   - Set up a cron job to run `cron/check_pending_tasks.php` for auto-cancelling old tasks.

### Running the Application
- Access the application via your browser at the configured base URL (e.g., `http://localhost/work`).
- Log in with your credentials (default users may be provided in the database seed).

## Usage Guide

### User Roles
- **Admin**: Full access to all features, can manage users, attendance, and tasks.
- **Manager**: Can view and manage attendance and tasks for employees.
- **Employee**: Can mark attendance and view assigned tasks/notifications.

### Attendance
- Employees mark attendance by recording a video (clock in/out) via `mark_attendance.php`.
- Managers/Admins view and filter attendance records in `attendance.php`.
- Videos are stored in the `uploads/attendance_videos/` directory.

### Notifications
- Notifications are shown in the header and on the notifications page.
- Users can mark notifications as read, delete individual notifications, or delete all notifications.

### Task Management
- Tasks can be assigned and tracked (feature may be extended in `tasks.php`).
- Pending tasks are auto-cancelled after a set period (see `includes/auto_cancel_tasks.php`).

## Customization & Extension
- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development. Customize in the `<head>` of `includes/header.php`.
- **Database**: Extend the schema for more features (e.g., leave requests, reports).
- **Security**: Ensure HTTPS is used in production. Sanitize all user inputs.
- **Notifications**: Extend notification types and triggers as needed.

## Troubleshooting
- **Database Errors**: Check credentials and table structure in `config/database.php`.
- **Uploads Not Working**: Ensure `uploads/attendance_videos/` is writable.
- **Session Issues**: Make sure PHP sessions are enabled and configured.
